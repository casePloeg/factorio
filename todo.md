- Problem: I want to automate making bmd's, but don't want more than 10 in my inventory so that resources don't get wasted on them, need a way to rate limit assemblers. 

- Problem: I have no idea what's happening in the system, need better logs for production / history of transactions. Are my mining drills keeping up with the furnaces? Is iron-plating supply low?
